How to install
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

simply extract the files into the root of your gta vice folder, the 
same place that gta-vice.exe is.

How to use
\\\\\\\\\\\

Start the trainer by running 'Vice ultimate trainer.exe', if you get 
any error messages here it is either because it is not in your gta 
vice folder or you have a incorrect version of the game.

once the trainer has started click on the settings button, a dialog 
will open that allows you to configure all the cheats in the trainer,
you can disable/enable a cheat by ticking the box next to it (ticked 
means enabled) and you can also redefine the hotkey by double clicking
on it (the blue text) and then selecting a new hotkey from the bottom 
of the dialog and clicking ok. once you have all the cheats as you
want them you can copy the list to the clipboard by pressing copy and
then paste them into a text editor like notepad to print them out.

Now that your cheats are ready, click ok to get back to the main menu.
You can now click Start Vice to start the game and use the hotkeys as
you like.

Teleporter
\\\\\\\\\\\

The teleporter works exactly like it did in the gta3 trainer, but as 
some people struggled with it i'll give you a few pointers, first, to 
use it you must alt-tab out the game when its running to get back to 
the desktop, now click the teleporter button, a form will be displayed,
now if you press the 'read xyz' button your current position in gta 
will be read and displayed in the boxes, is you want to save your 
current players position to return later enter a description in the 
bottom box and click store, that location will now be saved in the list
(the list can be saved and loaded from disk using the top 2 buttons). 
you can add as many locations as you like to the list and save for 
later use. To return too a stored location select it from the list, 
click 'write XYZ' and then click back on 'GTA:Vice' in the taskbar and
press resume, you'll now be back in the new location.

Notes
\\\\\\

* The trainer WILL NOT WORK while the settings dialog box is open

* you hotkey/cheat settings are saved in the keys.dat file.

* this trainer has been tested on win2k/xp using gta vice v1.0

* currently the garage editor is missing, maybe next release
